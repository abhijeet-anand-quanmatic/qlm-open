## Business Areas and Services

Quanmatic offers a range of services centered around mathematical optimization and quantum computing applications. Its solutions for operational optimization rely on proprietary algorithms designed to address complex business constraints. The company also focuses on the application of annealing technology and artificial intelligence, developing solutions for combinatorial optimization problems, machine learning, and hybrid AI-quantum models. In the field of gated quantum computing, Quanmatic works on quantum machine learning (QML) and quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) applications utilizing gate-model quantum computers and simulators.

## Innovations

Quanmatic has introduced several innovations to address limitations in current quantum hardware. These innovations include intellectual property (IP) that mitigates hardware constraints by reducing variables for faster convergence, avoiding local optima, and partitioning problems to bypass hardware limits. The company also focuses on developing practical, business-oriented algorithmic software tools, as well as pre-processing and post-processing tools that utilize graph theory, information engineering, and statistical physics to enhance quantum computing applications.

## Products

The company has developed several products that reflect its core focus areas. QLEANSER is a large-scale data analysis and auto-correction AI software. QUATTER is a tool designed for mathematical optimization and data partitioning. QANML is a general-purpose quantum algorithm software designed to broaden the application of quantum solutions across industries.

## Education

Quanmatic is committed to advancing quantum education through partnerships and self-developed platforms. Through a partnership with Xanadu, a Canadian quantum computing company, Quanmatic offers educational courses such as "Introduction to Quantum Computing" and "Quantum Machine Learning." Xanadu is known for its open-source software, PennyLane, which integrates quantum computing with machine learning. In addition to this, Quanmatic has developed ANCAR, a web application designed to provide tutorials, simulations, and advanced training modes for multiple annealing machines, including D-Wave 2000Q, Advantage, Digital Annealer, CMOS Annealing Machine, and Amplify Annealing Engine.
